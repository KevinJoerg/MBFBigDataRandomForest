## Agenda
1. Introduction
2. Data gathering & cleaning
3. Descriptive statistics
4. Methodological approach
5. Results
6. Points of further consideration

## Introduction (1/2)

The 2020 US-Presidential election led to the highest voter turnout in history

<center>

**Donald Trump Vs. Joe Bidden**

## Introduction (2/2)

### **But why was the interest in the election that high?**

Clash of different Ideologies:

<center>
Conservative vs. Liberal

Urban vs. Rural

Climate Protectionists vs. Climate deniers

</center>


But are those social gaps also visible when it comes to the American's love for big cars?


## Research question
<center>

### Do car characteristics have any predictive power for the US-presidential voting outcome?

<center>
## Data gathering(1/3)
### **Two data samples were used**
In a first step, two data sets were loaded:

1. USed Car dataset ***(Kaggle)***
    + 3 million cars that were listed on .... as of Sept. 2020
    + Each car was reported with xx characteristics
  --> total of xx data points
    + **total file size of ~10GB**
--> show sample
  
2. Precinct level voting outcome in the 2020 US-presidential election ***[MIT Election Lab]***
    + Voting outcome in xx states and xx counties
    + Number of republican, democrat and other Presidential candidates
    + **file size of xx GB**

## Data merging (2/3)
In a second step, the two data sets were merged

**Problem:** 

<center>

county level voting data vs. longitudonale/lattitudonale or ZIP code level car data

</center>


**Solution:**

1. Package 'jvamisc' retrieved from github to map lattitudonal & longitudonal car data to specific county
2. Add county voting outcome to each car data
3. Full data set constructed

## Data cleaning (3/3)

Three step cleaning approach

1. Strain Splitting and variable type definition 
2. Omit lacking datapoints
    - only cars with data on all potential variables were considered
3. Conceptional exclusion
    - some independent variables were heavily correlated to others
    e.g. hp vs. rpm
    - Non-distinctional car characteristic were excluded
    e.g. color??
4. Outliers
    - outliers were excluded by visually inspecting the factorial histograms
