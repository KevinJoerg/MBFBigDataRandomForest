## About

This repository is part of a project from the course "Big Data Analytics" at the University of St. Gallen. 

## How to execute this code

1. Download the dataset from: 

* US Used cars dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset
* MIT Election Lab Voting Data: https://github.com/MEDSL/2020-elections-official
* State Level Election Outcome: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX

2. Run code files sequentially

3. Check presentation for an overview on the methodology and results. 

### Note on executing this code 

* Linear regression uses GPU acceleration method. This may only work on NVIDIA GPUs which are CUDA enabled. 
* XGBoost takes up a lot of memory. If you do not have access to a powerful computer (on-premise or cloud), you may want to go ahead with 05_XGB_OOM (out-of-memory)
* XGBoost takes a long time to compute.
